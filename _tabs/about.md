Hey, I’m Sahariar — a software engineer with a knack for figuring out how things work when they don’t have to. I’m the type of person who’ll take apart a perfectly fine system just to see what’s inside.

I’m fascinated by the stuff that makes technology tick — things like network protocols, low-level systems, debugging mysteries, and how data travels through wires. If it involves performance optimizations or how a database quietly manages millions of records, I’m probably there with a magnifying glass and a cup of coffee.

This blog is where I share my deep dives, experiments, and the occasional rant when things go wrong. If you like getting into the nitty-gritty of tech, or you just enjoy watching someone try to untangle complex systems, you’re in the right place.

Let’s connect if you’re into building cool things (or if you’ve got a really good debugging story to share).
